## Evaluation 

- Practical component - 50% of the final grade  
- Practical component consists of 2 projects.
- The first project is evaluated based on a submitted report (IEEE format) and a short (10-15 min.) oral presentation.
- The second project is evaluated based on a submitted report (IEEE format).
- The students are encouraged to use Latex text editor. Overleaf is a convenient platform for collaborative writing and publishing using Latex (https://www.overleaf.com/) .
- Theoretical Component – 50% of the final grade (Final exam).


FINAL GRADE: First Project: 18.1; Second Project: 20; Exam: 13.9. FINAL MARK: 17
